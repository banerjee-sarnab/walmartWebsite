# E-Commerce Website with Product Recommendations

This project was developed for the Walmart Sparkathon and provides a functional e-commerce website that offers product recommendations tailored to user demographics and preferences. Key features include computing feature vectors for similarity-based recommendations, geolocation-based customization, and an interactive web interface.

## Features

- **Product Recommendations**: Computed feature vectors for items using Sentence Transformers for text and ResNet50 for images, allowing recommendation of similar products based on Cosine Similarity.
  
- **User Demographics Integration**: Integrated geolocation with the Llama-3-70B API to analyze user demographics from product descriptions and offer customized recommendations accordingly.
  
- **Interactive Web App**: Built a dynamic frontend with React and Django backend, featuring user authentication via `django-rest-auth` and specialized product filters for a seamless shopping experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Django with REST API
- **Authentication**: `django-rest-auth`
- **Database**: MySQL for data management
- **Modeling**: Sentence Transformers, ResNet50, and Cosine Similarity for recommendation system
